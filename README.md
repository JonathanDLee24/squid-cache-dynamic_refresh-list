# squid-cache-dynamic_refresh-list
List of dynamic_refresh patterns to use with squid3, and pfsense, I had a hard time finding things online, so I figured I'd make a collaborative github repo for just this purpose.

This list, is directly designed to be used with the pfsense squid package, however these refresh patterns should also work without using the pfsense specific squid package.
I am unable to confirm if they will work with a regular squid package on say ubuntu, however, because of the fact that these are directly designed for use with pfsense and squid together, but they should be the same formatting, so feel free to try if you so desire.

To use the custom refresh patten with squid with pfsense navigate to
Services - Squid Proxy Server â€“ Local Cache

Then first Clear Disk Cache NOW or else you may get issues (You must do this everytime you change the refresh patten)

Then in Dynamic and Update Content enable Cache Dynamic Content 

Then under Custom refresh_patterns paste in the refresh_patterns

Save
