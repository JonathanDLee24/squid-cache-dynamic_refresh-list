# squid-cache-dynamic_refresh-list
list of dynamic_refresh patterns to use with squid3, and pfsense, I had a hard time finding things online, so I figured I'd make a collaborative github repo for just this purpose.

this list, is directly designed to be used with pfsense' squid package, however these refresh patterns should also work without using the pfsense specific squid package.
I am unable to confirm if they will work with a regular squid package on say ubuntu, however, because of the fact that these are directly designed for use with pfsense and squid together, but they should be the same formatting, so feel free to try if you so desire.
